TYPOGRAPH
simple typesetting framework

Typograph provides a simple typesetting framework for generating consistent design without the
trouble of setting up a LaTeX document. It is not intended as a replacement for LaTeX, which
is an extremely powerful tool, rather a lightweight, yet full-featured typesetting tool with a
gentle learning curve.

Typograph only has three dependencies: typograph.css, typograph.js, and a MathJax installation.
Typograph can also be used with your own HTML/CSS/JS, if you wish to add more to your document
that Typograph is unable to provide (it is quite lightweight after all).

I hope you find it useful!
